/*
How many total burglaries were reported in 2013?
  
1) Creates a array with a sub array that contains the precinct in the first index and a default value of 0 for the second index. The second index will be used for keeping track of the burglaries for that precinct.
2) Creates a variable for number of burglaries
3) Then starts for loop to iterate through crime_stats array
4) Then starts conditional to signal out Burglaries in crime_stats array
5) Adds burglaries for that index position in crime_stats to numBurglaries variable
6) Then start if/else if conditional to add burglaries to precincts array to track number of burglaries for each precinct

/*
In which month were the fewest assaults reported? 

1) Created an array with a sub array for the months and # of assualts similar to the first array. However, in this one I created a variable for months. 
2) Start a for loop that iterates through crime_stats
3) Then I used an if statement if the month index postion in crime_stats was higher then it would add one to the variable.
4)Then I used an if statement to determine if that index position was an "Assault." If it was then it adds the number of assaults to the assaultsMonthly array
